# Beyond-Meat-Valuation

This is a project that I worked on in my second year valuation class, AFF420, valuing Beyond Meat during March and April of 2020 
This project technically involves relative and option pricing valuation but most of the work revolves around the DCF valuation 
The free cash flows to the firm(FCFF) are calculated using proforma statements being predicted 10 years into the future, from 2019 
Most of the valuation concepts are taken from Aswath Damodaran's "Investment of Valuation" University Edition 
The proforma statements are driven by three growth rates: Revenue, Capital Expenditures and Research and Development
